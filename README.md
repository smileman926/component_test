# Mind Over Tech Component Base repository

* Please could you create a milestone so that we can see how you work, and how your code looks building a specific component that we will then review and will pay the milestone regardless.

* Please create a milestone in Upwork for 2 hours work
* Please clone/fork this repository which has `create-react-app` and storybook installed. Please create ALL components in the components directory and follow the fractal app structure defined here ractal component design where necessary https://hackernoon.com/fractal-a-react-app-structure-for-infinite-scale-4dab943092af
* Please create the component that we have assigned to you
* You may need to run yarn install before it works
* We are really interested in your design skills at this point. Story book is a nice way to see a component, however if you don’t think you have time to make the stories, don’t worry, as long as we can see how you have designed and built the component, thats the most important thing. The stories will be required for the actual build, however please don’t waste time on them if it’s taking too long.
* When you have finished, push your work to your repository and give us the link to the final branch
Please don’t spend more than 2 hours in total, we are interested to see your design accuracy and your coding, but we are not concerned if the component is not 100% finished at this stage.

## N.B

* Please use yarn not npm
* Please leave meaningful git messages
* Please leave comments wherever possible/useful
* Please document your functions/stories so we can follow your flow
